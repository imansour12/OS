This OS is written in 16 bit assembly language also referred to as real mode. 32 bit assembly is called protected

0x7c00 is the place where the bios loads us

start means the program starts.

xor ax,ax sets ax to itself since its always equal to zero
and then you use the mov command to set all the other registers to zero
We use mov to store the memeory location we will use in the bx register



The db command stores data into variables 
call print_string prints a string
we define later in the code

when you mov ah, 0x0E, the CPU stops execution and does stuff
